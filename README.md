# Event-driven-simulator-C-plusplus-for-PPCP
This simulator is for the paper "Pulse Position Coded Medium Access in Energy-starved Networks".
Before run the simulator, please compile the cpp files first using "g++ Cluster_Interleaving.cpp Event.cpp Initialize\ Function\ and\ Result\ output.cpp Logfile.cpp Node.cpp PPCP\ Wireless\ Routing.cpp -o PPCP_cycle_2". 
Normally the code will run more than ten hours. It is highly recommended to run the code on HPCC.
